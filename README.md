# QuizRandom

Simple Quiz app made in Xamarin.

You "generate" quizzes with custom parameters: number of questions, difficulty, and category. The app then uses the https://opentdb.com/ API to retrieve the quiz.

Quizzes are saved to a local database on the phone.

You may play each quiz. The best attempt (most questions answered correctly) is saved and displayed.
